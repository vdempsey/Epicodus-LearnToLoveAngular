## Description
This is a personal project for Epicodus. The goal for this week is to discover and improve understanding of a challenging subject of past material. In my case it's Angular JS. I want to create an app that will allow me to create a diary of me falling in love with Angular JS:

Stage One:
1. Build a navigation menu (practice routing): Home, Diary, Resources
2. Display a list of diary entries for Angular JS (use Firebase to store, add and save data)
3. Build a form to add diary entries
4. Add buttons to edit and remove diary entry

Stage Two:
5. Build a form to add Resources
6. Add buttons to edit and remove resources

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
